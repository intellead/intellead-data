<h3>Introduction</h3>
Intellead Data aims to be an easy way to store and retrieval data for Intellead environment supporting by http protocol.
<h4>Features</h4>
This application provides lead registration, lead update and lead retrieval.
<h3>Instalation</h3>
intellead-data is a very smaller component that provide a simple way to receive data, store and retrieval.
This way you do not need to install any other components for this to work.
<h4>Dependencies</h4>
Despite what has been said above, today this application receives data from RDStation through a webhook made available by Digital Results. That way you need to use RDStation and configure a webhook to receive the data.
In the configuration section, we'll talk a bit more about this.
<h4>Get a copy</h4>
I like to encourage you to contribute to the repository.<br>
This should be as easy as possible for you but there are few things to consider when contributing. The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request.
<ul>
  <li>You need a GitHub account</li>
  <li>Submit an issue ticket for your issue if there is no one yet.</li>
  <li>If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub</li>
  <li>Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.</li>
  <li>If possible, submit tests to your patch / new feature so it can be tested easily.</li>
  <li>Assure nothing is broken by running all the tests.</li>
  <li>Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch.</li>
  <li>Even if you have write access to the repository, do not directly push or merge pull-requests. Let another team member review your pull request and approve.</li>
</ul>
